<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

#### Merging the digital and real-world experience through scavenger hunt games

It can be challenging to plan and manage group activities that are fun, interactive, cost-efficient and educational (if you want it to be). Trace allows for users to custom-create scavenger hunt games.

*Ideation & pitch*<br>

*Trace can be used by*
* **Companies** for team-building work activities
* **Schools** for trips and excursions
* **Governments and councils** to arrange educational city tours
* **Friends** for group social activities

*How it works*
1. Make a new game                                                   
2. Plot out the challenges, points and locations across the map
3. Share the unique game code with players
4. Players complete challenges by visiting each location and answering questions
5. Highest score and best time wins!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Admin 
- [ ] Include other challenge formats (e.g. QR code, snap a photo) to allow for further interactivity. Photo challenges can be replayed back to the players at the end of the game.

Player
- [ ] Update geo-location functionality to enable/disable challenge completion based on location proximity

General
- [ ] Responsiveness across desktop, tablet and mobile

See the [open issues](https://github.com/RebeccaL23/trace/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
